# SQL for Data Analysis   <!--E_Commerce Database-->

## üìå Description   <!-- Section Heading -->
This project is part of a **Data Analyst Internship Task**.  
The dataset used is an **E-Commerce Sales Database**, structured and queried using SQL.  

The main objective of this task was to **practice SQL for data extraction, transformation, and analysis**.  
Queries include filtering, sorting, aggregation, joins, subqueries, views, and optimization with indexes.  

## Key tasks performed   <!-- Section Heading -->

- Created `e_commerce` table with relevant fields (orders, customers, sales, etc.).   <!-- Bullet -->
- Inserted dataset from CSV into PostgreSQL.  
- Performed **data exploration** with SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY.  
- Applied **aggregate functions** (SUM, AVG) for sales & profit analysis.  
- Used **GROUP BY & HAVING** to segment performance by product category.  
- Implemented **INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN** queries for relational analysis.  
- Wrote **subqueries** to extract insights such as orders above average sales.  
- Created **SQL Views** for reusable analysis (e.g., high-value orders).  
- Added **indexes** on key columns to optimize query performance.  
- Implemented **window functions (RANK)** to find top products per category.  

## üìä Dataset   <!-- Section Heading -->

- Source: Internship E-Commerce SQL dataset  
- Table: `e_commerce`  
- Additional tables: `Customers`, `T_Methods`, `T_Devices`  

## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Operations   <!-- Section Heading -->

### Table Creation   <!-- Sub-heading -->
- Defined schema with correct datatypes.  
- Dropped unnecessary columns.  
- Loaded CSV into PostgreSQL using `COPY`.  

### Queries Implemented   <!-- Sub-heading -->
1. Filtering with `WHERE`   <!-- Numbered list -->
2. Sorting with `ORDER BY`  
3. Aggregation (`SUM`, `AVG`)  
4. Grouping with `GROUP BY` & `HAVING`  
5. Subqueries for comparative analysis  
6. Views for high-value orders  
7. Indexing for performance improvement  
8. Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)  
9. Window functions (`RANK()`) for top products  

## üìÇ Output   <!-- Section Heading -->
- SQL File: <a href="https://github.com/sabaribala2004-dataanalyst/Dashboard-Design/blob/main/AdidasSalesdata.xlsx"> Dataset</a>
- Screenshots: Query outputs stored in repo  
- Key insights documented in README  

## ‚úÖ Status   <!-- Section Heading -->
The project successfully demonstrates:  
- SQL querying for business analysis  
- Performance optimization using indexes  
- Creation of views for reusable reporting  

This ensures the dataset is fully **analysis-ready** and SQL skills are applied to real-world use cases.
